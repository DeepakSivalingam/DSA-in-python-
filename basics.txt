Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) refer to the study of methods for organizing and storing data and 
the design of procedures (algorithms) for solving problems, which operate on these data structures

two types of DSA
1.linear 
   * array (static data structure)
   * stack (dynamic)
   * queue (dynamic)
   * linked list (dynamic)

2.non_linear
   * tree
   * graph
   * heap

TIME COMPLEXITY
1. big O notation
2. omega notation
3. theta notation

Big O notation 
 1.o(1)---- constant 
 2.o(n)---- linear 
 3.o(logN)-----lograthmic
 4.o(NlogN)-----linear lograthmic
 5.O(n^2)-----quadratic
